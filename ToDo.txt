How to handle executables? TreeView or Table/List?

1. TreeView
- User creates/edits categories
- User creates/edits commands
- User can drag commands to other categories
- User can right-click and duplicate commands

2. Table/List
- User creates/edits commands (incl. category)
  con: cannot change category name of multiple commands
- Commands are listed according to their category

Either way:
Exe path and commands should be visible
- Optional: Exe icon
